# SpaceTest1 - Stock Monitor Application

## Introduction

The **SpaceTest1** project is a stock monitoring application built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It provides users with real-time stock market data, allows for monitoring of selected stocks, and offers an intuitive interface for easy navigation. This project showcases core front-end development skills, focusing on data handling, UI design, and performance optimization.

## Solution Overview

The solution integrates data from a third-party API to display real-time stock data in a tabular format. The application allows users to:

- Monitor key stock metrics such as price, volume, and change percentage.
- Add and remove stocks from their watchlist.
- Sort and filter stock data based on user preferences.

This app is designed with scalability and performance in mind, utilizing TypeScript for robust type-checking and Next.js for server-side rendering, ensuring fast load times and smooth navigation.

## Approach

The development process followed these key principles:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: The UI is broken down into modular, reusable React components (e.g., `StockTable`, `StockRow`), ensuring that each part of the application can be independently developed, tested, and maintained.
- **API Integration**: The app fetches stock data from an external API using Next.js's server-side capabilities, enabling the display of real-time stock information.
- **State Management**: React's built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) are used for local state management. Stocks are managed within components, ensuring clean separation of concerns.
- **TypeScript for Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures that the types of the fetched stock data are strictly defined, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving the overall robustness of the code.
- **SSR for Performance**: Server-side rendering ensures that users can quickly access data as it is pre-rendered on the server, making the initial load faster and SEO-friendly.

## Design Thought Process

- **User-Centric UI**: The interface is designed to be intuitive, with clear buttons for adding and removing stocks, and tables displaying well-organized data for quick analysis.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, providing a consistent experience across devices.
- **Error Handling**: The app gracefully handles API errors and displays appropriate feedback to users in case of network issues or API failures.
- **Optimized Rendering**: By utilizing Reactâ€™s reconciliation and SSR features, the app minimizes re-rendering and ensures that only the necessary components are updated.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript, ensuring more predictable code behavior.
- **React**: For building modular, reusable UI components.
- **CSS Modules**: For component-scoped styling to prevent conflicts.
- **Stock API**: Integration with a third-party stock data API for fetching real-time stock information.
- **Deployment**: The application is deployed on **Vercel**, providing seamless integration with Next.js for optimized performance and scalability.

## Limitations

- **Limited API Rate**: The stock data API used has a limited number of requests per day, which may affect the accuracy and timeliness of stock data updates.
- **Basic State Management**: Currently, the state management only handles local state within individual components. Introducing a global state management system like Redux could provide better handling of complex data interactions.
- **No User Authentication**: The app lacks user-specific features like personalized stock lists tied to accounts, which would require backend integration for full functionality.

## Future Improvements

- **Global State Management**: Implement Redux or Context API for handling global states, such as a stock watchlist that persists across components and sessions.
- **Authentication and User Profiles**: Add user authentication using OAuth or similar methods to allow users to save personalized stock watchlists.
- **Data Caching**: Implement caching strategies to minimize API requests and reduce load times, especially for frequently monitored stocks.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests using **Jest** and integration tests with **React Testing Library** to improve code quality and ensure that edge cases are handled.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improve the stock table's design by adding color indicators (e.g., red/green for price changes), tooltips, and pagination for large datasets.
